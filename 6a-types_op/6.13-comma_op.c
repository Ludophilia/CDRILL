	/* Treating variadic parameters in C is quite of a challenge that relies on 
	<stdarg.h> to be overcome. In this library: 
		- va_list is a structure type that holds the variadic parameters. This 
		type is suitable for holding info needed by the three macros va_start(), 
		va_arg() and va_end().
		- the va_start(va_list, T) macro enables access to the variable 
		arguments va_list following the named argument parmN.
		- va_arg(va_list, T) returns an expression of type T that corresponds 
		to the next parameter from the va_list. Prior to calling va_arg, a 
		va_list instance must be initialized by a call to either va_start or
		va_copy, with no intervening call to va_end. EACH invocation of the 
		va_arg macro modifies va_list instance to point to the next variable 
		argument.
		- va_end(va_list) - the va_end macro performs cleanup for an va_list 
		instance initialized by a call to va_start or va_copy. va_end may 
		modify ap so that it is no longer usable.

	function with an extra parameter.
	If you want to use the comma operator in a function argument, you need to
	put PARENTHESES around it. Thatâ€™s because COMMAS in a function argument 
	list have a different meaning: they SEPARATE ARGUMENTS. 
	Thus, f(w, x = 47, y, z) is interpreted as a function call with four
